# What Should I Draw?

#### Overview:

Are you an artist in a rut or lacking inspiration? Just looking for ideas to get the creative juices flowing? Welcome to What Should I Draw? The simple application that randomly generates an adjective and noun that aim to plant a seed of inspiration. Prompts range from boringly simple to thought-provokingly abstract -- it's up to each artist to choose which prompts they want to interpret as possible masterpieces.
